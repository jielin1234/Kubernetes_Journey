**Advantages**:
- Application is now highly available as hardware failures to not bring the application down as there is multiple instance of the application running on different nodes. The user traffic is load balanced across the various containers.
- It can also scale the number of underlying nodes up/down without having to take down the application and do all these easily w a set of declarative object configuration files.
