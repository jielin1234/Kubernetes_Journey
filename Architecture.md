- Node
	- Node is a machine, physical or virtual on which K8S is installed
	- Node is a worker machine and that is where containers will be launched by K8S
	- Need to have more than 1 node, if only 1 node and it fails, then the app will go down
	- Worker nodes contains kubelet agent, to interact with a master to provide health info and carry out actions requested by the Master. 
	- Also contains Container runtime (e.g. Docker)
- Cluster
	- Cluster is a set of nodes grouped together, so even if 1 node fail, the app is still accessible from the other nodes and helps in sharing loads as well
- Master
	- Another node with K8S installed and is configured as master
	- Master watches over the nodes in the cluster and is responsible for the actual orchestration of containers on the worker nodes
	- Master node contains kube-apiserver
	- Master nodes contain etcd where all the info gathered are stored here.
	- Also contain controller and schedular components:
- Components
	- When install K8S on a system, it is actually installing the following components:
		- API server: Acts as front end for K8S. The users, device, CLI all talk to the API to interact w/ the K8S cluster.
		- etcd: Reliable key value store to store all data used to manage the cluster. Ensure that no conflicts btwn the masters.
		- kubelet: The agent that runs on each node in the cluster. Reponsible to make sure the container are running on the nodes as expected.
		- Container Runtime: The underlying sw used to run containers (e.g. Docker)
		- Controller: The brain behind orchestration. Reponsible for noticing and responding when nodes or endpoint goes down. It make decision to bring up new containers in such cases.
		- Scheduler: Distribute works/containers across multiple nodes. Look for newly created containers and assign them to nodes.
- How to differentiate Master & Worker nodes?
	- Master: Contains kube apiserver, etcd, controller, scheduler
	- Worker: Contains kubelet, container runtime
